# Work-in-R
This repository contains all my work in R language (powered by Rstudio)
The PDF documents contain R practice questions of the given topics (see brackets in the file name) and the R scripts contain the R codes answering questions in the corresponding PDF document with the same name.
The 'Exercise sheet' series work are done during the module 'Econometrics' (module code: EC226) in the University of Warwick.
